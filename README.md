  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  ## Description
  This is a NoSQL Social Network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is built using Node.js and Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. This app is user-friendly and you can also use CRUD operations and other requests to get all the users and thoughts listed in database.
  

Here is a walkthrough video of my application: "https://www.loom.com/share/e0ab8766f8314f2bb9440329df139ec5"
